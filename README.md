**C++ for Option Pricing**

## Project Overview
This project implements various financial models for pricing European and American options using C++. It covers fundamental and advanced methodologies, ensuring efficient and accurate computation of option prices. The key focus areas include:

## **Black-Scholes Model**
Implementation of the European Vanilla Option (Call & Put).
Analytical pricing formula using the Black-Scholes equation.
Calculation of option Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, etc.).
Monte Carlo simulation for Black-Scholes option pricing.

## **Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) Binomial Model**
Construction of a binomial tree for option pricing.
Backward induction for European and American options.
Risk-neutral probability calculations.
Efficient implementation of the CRR algorithm.

## **Advanced Option Pricing Techniques**
Path-dependent options: Implementation of Asian options with Monte Carlo simulation.
Digital options: Pricing of binary payoffs using both Black-Scholes and CRR models.
American options: Early exercise decision using the binomial model.
Wavelet analysis & stochastic modeling: Exploration of advanced techniques for market behavior prediction.
